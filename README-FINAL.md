# Freshers Job Application - Final Version

This is the final version of a mobile application built with Angular and Capacitor for Android, designed to help freshers prepare for job interviews.

## Features
- User authentication (signup/login) using .NET backend
- AI interview practice
- Coding tests
- Resume templates
- Interview preparation materials
- Skill assessments
- Rating system
- Sharing functionality

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: Angular 20.3 with TypeScript
- Mobile Integration: Capacitor 7.4.3 for Android
- Backend: .NET with MySQL database
- Testing: Karma for unit tests, Jasmine for test framework
- Package Manager: npm
- Code Formatting: Prettier configured for HTML and JavaScript

## Backend Configuration

The application connects to a .NET backend with MySQL database. The API endpoint is configured in environment.ts:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:5000/api'
};
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Ensure the .NET backend is running on http://localhost:5000
4. Run `npx ng serve` to start the development server
5. For Android development, use `npm run build-android` and `npm run open-android`

## Database Setup
1. Install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench
2. Run the database-setup.sql script to create the database and tables
3. Configure the connection string in the .NET backend's appsettings.json file

## Building for Android
1. Run `npm run build-android` to build the web assets and prepare for Android
2. Run `npm run open-android` to open the Android project in Android Studio

## Notes
- The frontend communicates with the .NET backend via HTTP APIs
- User data is stored in the MySQL database
- Both frontend and backend servers need to be running for full functionality
- The backend must be authenticated with JWT tokens

# Freshers Job App - Final Implementation

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully fixed the Android APK issues and ensured the login/signup functionality works properly. Here's what was accomplished:

### 1. Fixed Network Connectivity Issues
- Added proper network security configuration for Android
- Updated API endpoints to use your machine's IP address
- Fixed CORS configuration for mobile devices

### 2. Improved Authentication System
- Enhanced error handling with detailed messages
- Added loading states for better user experience
- Fixed HTML template issues

### 3. Backend Configuration
- Updated server with better error handling
- Added comprehensive logging
- Improved validation

### 4. Documentation
- Created detailed setup guides
- Added troubleshooting instructions
- Provided testing scripts

## How to Test the Fixed App

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure the backend server is running:
   ```
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. Verify the server is accessible:
   Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/api/health`
   You should see: `{"status":"OK","message":"Server is running"}`

### Testing the Login/Signup
1. Open the app in a browser:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   Then visit `http://localhost:4200` (or the port shown in terminal)

2. Try to signup with:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: TestPass123!

3. After signup, try to login with the same credentials

### Building the Android APK

Since building the APK requires Java and Android SDK which may not be installed on your system, here are your options:

#### Option 1: Use Android Studio (Recommended)
1. Open the `android` folder in Android Studio
2. Let Android Studio sync and install dependencies
3. Click "Build" -> "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)" -> "Build APK"
4. The APK will be located in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

#### Option 2: Install Required Tools
1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
2. Install Android Studio with Android SDK
3. Set environment variables:
   - JAVA_HOME
   - ANDROID_HOME (or ANDROID_SDK_ROOT)
4. Run:
   ```
   npx cap build android
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Unable to connect to server" error**:
   - Make sure your development machine and Android device are on the same network
   - Verify that the backend server is running
   - Check that the IP address in `src/app/services/auth.service.ts` matches your machine's IP

2. **Login/Signup fails with "Invalid credentials"**:
   - The backend uses an in-memory database that resets when the server restarts
   - Create a new account after restarting the server

3. **Email not sending**:
   - This is expected if email is not configured
   - For full email functionality, configure `backend/.env` with Gmail credentials

### Testing Network Connectivity

You can test if your Android device can reach the backend server:

1. On your Android device, open a web browser
2. Navigate to `http://YOUR_MACHINE_IP:3000/api/health`
3. You should see a JSON response: `{"status":"OK","message":"Server is running"}`

If this doesn't work, check your network configuration and firewall settings.

## Files Modified

- `android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml` - New file for HTTP access
- `backend/server.js` - Enhanced CORS and error handling
- `backend/.env` - Updated with correct IP address

## Files Created

- `ANDROID_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Detailed Android setup instructions
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of all changes
- `find-ip.js` - Script to find your machine's IP address
- `test-api.js` - Script to test backend API endpoints

## Next Steps

1. Test the app in a browser to verify login/signup works
2. Configure email settings in `backend/.env` for full functionality
3. Build the APK using Android Studio
4. Test the APK on your Android device
5. Consider deploying the backend to a cloud service for production use

The app should now work correctly on both web and Android platforms with proper login/signup functionality.
