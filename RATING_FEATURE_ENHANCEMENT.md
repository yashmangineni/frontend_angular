### Rating Distribution Visualization
Users can now see:
- How many users gave 5 stars
- How many users gave 4 stars
- How many users gave 3 stars
- How many users gave 2 stars
- How many users gave 1 star

Each rating is displayed with:
- A visual bar showing the percentage of total ratings
- The actual count of ratings for that star value

### Complete Ratings Display
Instead of only showing recent ratings, the app now shows:
- All ratings submitted by users
- Each rating with its star value, date, and optional comment
- A clear count of total ratings

## How to Test

1. **Loading Page Navigation**:
   - Open the app and observe the loading screen
   - After 2 seconds, you should be redirected to the login page if not logged in
   - If logged in, you should be redirected to the interview page

2. **Login/Signup Links**:
   - When not logged in, you should see "Login" and "Signup" links in the header
   - Click these links to navigate to the respective pages

3. **Rating System**:
   - Navigate to the "Rate Us" page from the sidebar menu
   - Submit a few ratings with different star values and comments
   - Observe the rating distribution visualization
   - See all ratings displayed in the list
   - Note the total ratings count

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**:
   - Users can now access login/signup directly from the header
   - Clear navigation path from loading screen
   - Enhanced rating visualization provides more insights

2. **Transparency**:
   - Users can see all ratings, not just recent ones
   - Rating distribution shows the overall sentiment
   - Total ratings count gives an idea of app popularity

3. **Improved Design**:
   - Modern, responsive design works on all devices
   - Visual rating distribution is easy to understand
   - Clean, professional appearance

## Technical Implementation

The rating system still uses localStorage for data persistence, which means:
- Ratings are stored locally on each user's device
- Ratings are not shared between users or devices
- In a production environment, this would be replaced with a backend database

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow existing code patterns.
