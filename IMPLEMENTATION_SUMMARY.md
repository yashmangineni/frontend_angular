## How to Test the Fixes

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Verify the server is running**:
   Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/health`
   You should see: `{"status":"OK","message":"Server is running"}`

3. **Test the API endpoints**:
   - Signup: POST to `http://localhost:3000/api/users`
   - Login: POST to `http://localhost:3000/api/login`

## How to Build the Android APK

### Prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
2. Android Studio with Android SDK
3. Environment variables set:
   - JAVA_HOME
   - ANDROID_HOME (or ANDROID_SDK_ROOT)

### Steps:
1. Build the Angular app:
   ```
   ng build
   ```

2. Copy web assets to Android:
   ```
   npx cap copy
   ```

3. Update Android project:
   ```
   npx cap update
   ```

4. Build the APK:
   ```
   npx cap build android
   ```

### Alternative Method (Using Android Studio):
1. Open the `android` folder in Android Studio
2. Let Android Studio sync and install dependencies
3. Click "Build" -> "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)" -> "Build APK"
4. The APK will be located in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Unable to connect to server" error**:
   - Make sure your development machine and Android device are on the same network
   - Verify that the backend server is running
   - Check that the IP address in the code matches your machine's IP

2. **Email not sending**:
   - Verify that you're using a Gmail App Password, not your regular password
   - Check that the EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS values in `.env` are correct
   - Make sure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled on your Google account

3. **"User already exists" error**:
   - The backend uses an in-memory database that resets when the server restarts
   - If you're getting this error, the server may still be running from a previous session

### Testing Network Connectivity:

You can test if your Android device can reach the backend server:

1. On your Android device, open a web browser
2. Navigate to `http://YOUR_MACHINE_IP:3000/api/health`
3. You should see a JSON response: `{"status":"OK","message":"Server is running"}`

If this doesn't work, check your network configuration and firewall settings.

## Next Steps

1. Configure email settings in `backend/.env` for full functionality
2. Set up Java and Android SDK for building APKs
3. Test the APK on your Android device
4. Consider deploying the backend to a cloud service for production use
