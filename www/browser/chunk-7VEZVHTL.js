It is the successor to AngularJS."},{q:"What is npm install and why do we use it?",a:"npm install is used to download and install dependencies (packages) required for a project from the npm registry. In Angular, it is used to install Angular CLI, libraries, and modules."},{q:"What is bootstrapping in Angular?",a:"Bootstrapping is the process of initializing or starting an Angular application. It involves loading the root module (AppModule) and root component (AppComponent) to start the app."},{q:"What are Angular directives?",a:`Directives are instructions in the DOM. They can modify behavior or appearance. There are three types: 
1. Component directives \u2013 define components
2. Structural directives \u2013 change DOM structure (e.g., *ngIf, *ngFor)
3. Attribute directives \u2013 change appearance/behavior of elements (e.g., [ngStyle], [ngClass])`},{q:"What is a component in Angular?",a:"A component is a basic building block of an Angular app that contains HTML template, CSS styles, and TypeScript logic. Components interact through @Input() and @Output() decorators."},{q:"What is component interaction?",a:`Component interaction is communication between components. Types include:
1. Parent to Child (@Input)
2. Child to Parent (@Output + EventEmitter)
3. Sibling via shared service
4. ViewChild/ViewChildren references`},{q:"What is Angular routing?",a:"Routing allows navigation between different components or pages without refreshing the browser. Angular Router handles URL mapping to components."},{q:"What are Angular services?",a:"Services are singleton objects used to share data, logic, or functions across components. They promote code reusability and are typically injected using Dependency Injection."},{q:"What is an Observable in Angular?",a:"An Observable is a stream of data that can be observed over time, provided by RxJS. It allows asynchronous operations like HTTP requests to be handled reactively."},{q:"What is a Promise in Angular?",a:"A Promise represents a single future value or error. It is used for asynchronous operations but cannot handle multiple values over time like Observables."},{q:"What is lazy loading in Angular?",a:"Lazy loading is a technique to load modules only when they are needed, reducing initial load time and improving performance."},{q:"What are Angular forms and their types?",a:`Angular provides two types of forms:
1. Template-driven forms \u2013 simple, defined in HTML template, suitable for simple scenarios.
2. Reactive forms \u2013 more robust, defined in TypeScript, provides full control and validation logic.`},{q:"What are Angular lifecycle hooks?",a:"Lifecycle hooks are methods that allow developers to tap into key events of a component or directive, like creation, update, and destruction. Examples: ngOnInit, ngOnChanges, ngOnDestroy."},{q:"What is JIT vs AOT compilation in Angular?",a:`JIT (Just-in-Time) compiles the app in the browser at runtime.
AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compiles the app during build time, leading to faster rendering and smaller bundle size.`},{q:"Difference between find() vs filter() in JavaScript?",a:`find() returns the first element matching a condition.
filter() returns an array of all elements matching a condition.`},{q:"What are directives?",a:"Instructions in the DOM that change its appearance or behavior, like *ngIf and *ngFor."},{q:"What are services?",a:"Reusable classes for sharing data or logic across components."},{q:"What is dependency injection?",a:"A design pattern where Angular automatically provides dependencies to classes."},{q:"What are modules?",a:"Containers for related components, directives, pipes, and services."},{q:"What is Angular CLI?",a:"Command-line interface tool to generate and manage Angular projects."},{q:"What is RxJS?",a:"Reactive programming library for handling asynchronous data streams."},{q:"What are pipes?",a:"Transform data in templates, e.g., date, uppercase, or custom pipes."},{q:"What is routing in Angular?",a:"Mechanism to navigate between views using the Router module."},{q:"What is change detection?",a:"The process Angular uses to update the view when the model changes."},{q:"What are forms in Angular?",a:"Template-driven or reactive forms for handling user input and validation."},{q:"What is lazy loading?",a:"Loading feature modules only when needed to reduce initial load time."},{q:"What is Angular Universal?",a:"Server-side rendering solution for Angular apps for better SEO and performance. "},{q:"What are the types of data binding in Angular?",a:"There are four types: Interpolation, Property Binding, Event Binding, and Two-Way Binding."},{q:"What is a Single Page Application (SPA)?",a:"A SPA is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without refreshing the entire page, providing a faster and smoother user experience."},{q:"What is TypeScript?",a:"TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types and compile-time checking. It helps catch errors early and makes code more maintainable. Angular is built using TypeScript."},{q:"What is Interpolation?",a:"Interpolation allows you to display component data in the template using {{ }} syntax. Example: <h1>{{title}}</h1>."},{q:"What is Property Binding?",a:'Property binding sets values of HTML element properties dynamically. Example: <img [src]="imageUrl">.'},{q:"What is Event Binding?",a:'Event binding listens to events like clicks and executes a component method. Example: <button (click)="onClick()">Click Me</button>.'},{q:"What is Two-Way Binding?",a:'Two-way binding allows simultaneous data update between model and view using [(ngModel)]. Example: <input [(ngModel)]="username">.'}];static \u0275fac=function(e){return new(e||a)};static \u0275cmp=l({type:a,selectors:[["app-lang-angular"]],decls:6,vars:1,consts:[[1,"qa-container"],[1,"subtitle"],[4,"ngFor","ngForOf"]],template:function(e,m){e&1&&(t(0,"div",0)(1,"h2"),i(2,"Angular Interview Q&A"),n(),t(3,"h3",1),i(4,"Freshers\u2019 Easy Guide \u2014 Crack Interviews from Basics \u279D Advanced"),n(),d(5,h,6,2,"div",2),n()),e&2&&(r(5),p("ngForOf",m.qaData))},dependencies:[g,c],styles:['.qa-container[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{max-width:600px;margin:auto;background:#fff;border-radius:12px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px #0000001a;padding:20px;font-family:Arial,sans-serif}.qa-container[_ngcontent-%COMP%]   h2[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px;color:#1a73e8}details[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:8px;padding:12px 16px;margin-bottom:12px;background:#fafafa;transition:all .3s ease-in-out}details[_ngcontent-%COMP%]:hover{background:#f0f6ff;border-color:#1a73e8}summary[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{font-weight:600;cursor:pointer;position:relative}summary[_ngcontent-%COMP%]:after{content:"+";position:absolute;right:0;font-size:18px;transition:transform .3s ease}details[open][_ngcontent-%COMP%]   summary[_ngcontent-%COMP%]:after{content:"-";transform:rotate(180deg)}details[_ngcontent-%COMP%]   p[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{margin-top:10px;color:#333;line-height:1.5}.subtitle[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{text-align:center;font-size:1rem;font-weight:500;color:#555;margin-bottom:20px}']})};export{u as a};
