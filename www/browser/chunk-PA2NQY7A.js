It controls layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of web page elements."},{q:"What are the different types of CSS?",a:`1. **Inline CSS** \u2013 Using style attribute inside HTML elements.
2. **Internal CSS** \u2013 Using <style> tag in the head section.
3. **External CSS** \u2013 Linking an external .css file using <link> tag.`},{q:"What is the difference between ID and Class selectors?",a:"ID (#id) is **unique** and applied to one element. Class (.class) can be applied to **multiple elements**."},{q:"What is the difference between relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning?",a:`1. **relative** \u2013 positioned relative to its normal position.
2. **absolute** \u2013 positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor.
3. **fixed** \u2013 positioned relative to viewport; stays on screen.
4. **sticky** \u2013 toggles between relative and fixed based on scroll position.`},{q:"What is the difference between inline, block, and inline-block elements?",a:`1. **inline** \u2013 does not start a new line (e.g., <span>).
2. **block** \u2013 starts on a new line, takes full width (e.g., <div>).
3. **inline-block** \u2013 behaves like inline but allows block properties like width and height.`},{q:"What is the difference between relative units (em, rem) and absolute units (px)?",a:`**px** \u2013 fixed size in pixels.
**em** \u2013 relative to the font size of the parent.
**rem** \u2013 relative to the font size of the root element.`},{q:"What are pseudo-classes in CSS?",a:"Pseudo-classes define **special states of elements**. Examples: :hover, :focus, :first-child, :nth-child(n), :active."},{q:"What are pseudo-elements in CSS?",a:"Pseudo-elements define **specific parts of elements**. Examples: ::before, ::after, ::first-letter, ::first-line."},{q:"What is the difference between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning in CSS?",a:`Relative: Moves element relative to its normal position.
Absolute: Positions element relative to nearest positioned ancestor.
Fixed: Stays fixed relative to viewport even when scrolling.`},{q:"What is the difference between inline style, internal style, and external style?",a:`Inline: style="color:red"
Internal: <style> inside HTML <head>
External: linked CSS file <link rel="stylesheet">`},{q:"What is the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox?",a:`Flexbox \u2013 one-dimensional layout (row or column).
Grid \u2013 two-dimensional layout (rows and columns).
Use Flexbox for smaller layouts and Grid for complex layouts.`},{q:"What are media queries?",a:`Media queries allow **responsive design** by applying CSS based on device width, height, orientation, or resolution. Example:
@media (max-width: 768px) { body { background: lightblue; } }`},{q:"What is the CSS Box Model?",a:"The CSS Box Model describes how **elements are structured and spaced** in a web page. Every element is represented as a rectangular box consisting of **content, padding, border, and margin**."},{q:"What are the parts of the Box Model?",a:`1. **Content** \u2013 The actual content of the element (text, images, etc.).
2. **Padding** \u2013 Space between content and border. It adds extra space inside the element.
3. **Border** \u2013 Surrounds the padding (and content) and can have width, style, and color.
4. **Margin** \u2013 Space outside the border. Creates distance between elements.`},{q:"What is the difference between padding and margin?",a:`Padding is the **space inside** the element between content and border.
Margin is the **space outside** the element between the element\u2019s border and surrounding elements.`},{q:"What is the difference between border and outline?",a:`Border is part of the box model and affects layout.
Outline is **drawn outside** the element\u2019s border and does not affect layout or size.`},{q:"What is the default box-sizing in CSS?",a:"By default, **box-sizing is content-box**, which means width and height only include the content. Padding and border are added outside this size."},{q:"How to include padding and border in the element\u2019s total width?",a:"Use **box-sizing: border-box;** This makes the width and height include **content + padding + border**, making sizing easier and layout predictable."},{q:"What is the difference between content-box and border-box?",a:`content-box: width/height include only the content, padding and border are added outside.
border-box: width/height include content, padding, and border inside the specified size.`},{q:"What is the difference between relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning?",a:`Relative: relative to normal position
Absolute: relative to nearest positioned ancestor
Fixed: relative to viewport
Sticky: toggles between relative and fixed when scrolling`},{q:"What is the difference between visibility:hidden and display:none?",a:`visibility:hidden \u2013 element is invisible but takes space.

transition: all 0.3s ease;`},{q:"What are animations in CSS?",a:`Animations allow **keyframe-based movement or property changes**. Example:

Examples: ::before, ::after, ::first-letter, ::first-line."},{q:"What is CSS specificity?",a:"Specificity determines which CSS rule applies when multiple rules target the same element. Inline styles > ID selectors > Class/attribute/pseudo-class selectors > Element/pseudo-element selectors."},{q:"What is the difference between relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning?",a:`Relative: relative to normal position.
Absolute: relative to nearest positioned ancestor.
Fixed: fixed to viewport.
Sticky: switches between relative and fixed based on scroll.`},{q:"What is the difference between visibility:hidden and display:none?",a:`visibility:hidden: element is invisible but still occupies space.
display:none: element is removed from the layout and occupies no space.`},{q:"What is the difference between em, rem, %, and px units in CSS?",a:`px: absolute pixels.
