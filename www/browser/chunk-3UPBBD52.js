This reduces tight coupling."},{q:"What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?",a:"spring framework control of managing the bean life cycle,configuration,bean dependencies. it allows for loose coupling between beans ,promotes modularity and smplifies  the configuration and management of application behaviour"},{q:"What are Spring Beans?",a:"Spring Beans are objects that are managed by the Spring IoC container. They are defined in configuration or annotated with @Component, @Service, etc."},{q:"What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?",a:"BeanFactory is the basic container with lazy loading. ApplicationContext is an advanced container that supports AOP, events, internationalization, and eager loading."},{q:"What are the types of Spring Bean scopes?",a:"singleton (default), prototype, request, session, application, and websocket (in Spring Web)."},{q:"What is Spring MVC?",a:"A web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller pattern. It uses DispatcherServlet as a front controller to handle all web requests."},{q:"What is the role of @Autowired annotation?",a:"@Autowired is used for automatic dependency injection. Spring automatically resolves and injects the required bean."},{q:"What is AOP in Spring?",a:"Aspect-Oriented Programming separates cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions from business logic using aspects, advice, and joinpoints."},{q:"What is Spring Boot and why is it used?",a:"Spring Boot is built on Spring and provides auto-configuration, starter dependencies, and embedded servers. It simplifies setup and speeds up development."},{q:"What are advantages of Spring Boot over Spring?",a:"Auto-configuration, starter dependencies, embedded servers, Actuator for monitoring, and minimal XML configuration."},{q:"What is the difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository?",a:"@Component is a generic stereotype. @Service is used in the business layer. @Repository is used in the persistence layer (DAO)."},{q:"What is @RestController in Spring Boot?",a:"It is a combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody, used to build REST APIs that return JSON or XML directly."},{q:"What is the use of Spring Boot Actuator?",a:"Actuator provides production-ready features like monitoring and management endpoints (health, metrics, env, etc.)."},{q:"How does Spring Boot handle external configuration?",a:"It uses application.properties or application.yml, environment variables, command-line arguments, and config servers."},{q:"What is Spring Data JPA?",a:"Spring Data JPA simplifies database access using JPA. It provides interfaces like CrudRepository and JpaRepository to reduce boilerplate code."},{q:"What is the difference between @RequestParam and @PathVariable?",a:"@RequestParam extracts query parameters (e.g., /users?id=1). @PathVariable extracts values from the URI path (e.g., /users/1)."},{q:"How does Spring Boot handle exception handling?",a:"It uses @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler for centralized exception handling across the application."},{q:"What is Spring Security?",a:"Spring Security is a framework for authentication and authorization. It provides features like login forms, role-based access, CSRF protection, OAuth2, and JWT."}];static \u0275fac=function(e){return new(e||n)};static \u0275cmp=p({type:n,selectors:[["app-lang-spring"]],decls:6,vars:1,consts:[[1,"qa-container"],[1,"subtitle"],[4,"ngFor","ngForOf"]],template:function(e,u){e&1&&(a(0,"div",0)(1,"h2"),i(2,"Spring Interview Q&A"),t(),a(3,"h3",1),i(4,"Freshers\u2019 Easy Guide \u2014 Crack Interviews from Basics \u279D Advanced"),t(),c(5,f,6,2,"div",2),t()),e&2&&(o(5),d("ngForOf",u.qaData))},dependencies:[g,l],styles:['.qa-container[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{max-width:600px;margin:auto;background:#fff;border-radius:12px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px #0000001a;padding:20px;font-family:Arial,sans-serif}.qa-container[_ngcontent-%COMP%]   h2[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px;color:#1a73e8}details[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:8px;padding:12px 16px;margin-bottom:12px;background:#fafafa;transition:all .3s ease-in-out}details[_ngcontent-%COMP%]:hover{background:#f0f6ff;border-color:#1a73e8}summary[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{font-weight:600;cursor:pointer;position:relative}summary[_ngcontent-%COMP%]:after{content:"+";position:absolute;right:0;font-size:18px;transition:transform .3s ease}details[open][_ngcontent-%COMP%]   summary[_ngcontent-%COMP%]:after{content:"-";transform:rotate(180deg)}details[_ngcontent-%COMP%]   p[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{margin-top:10px;color:#333;line-height:1.5}.subtitle[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{text-align:center;font-size:1rem;font-weight:500;color:#555;margin-bottom:20px}']})};export{m as a};
